    "* It's capable of measuring the **volatility** of the prices\n",
    "* It helps to visualize maximums and minimums \n",
    "* It helps to identify **overvaluation** and **undervaluation** of the prices\n",
    "  * When the price is **overvalued** you may want to **sell it** expecting that after that appreciation period, the prices will **decrease**\n",
    "  * When the price is **devalued** you may want to **buy it** expecting that after that depreciation period, the prices will **increase**\n",

    "* $20$ is the number of contiguous days considered to calculate the standard deviation and the moving average - normally it's treated as a standard.\n",
    "* The standard deviation is multiplied by $2$ using a statistics fact that in a normal distribution $95\\%$ of the values will be in a distance of $2 * stdev$ from the average, but this is not totally true for this case because the prices may not follow a normal distribution\n",

    "* **Support** is a region where the prices face a difficulty to continue to **fall** e.g. **buyers** are taking control of the market \n",

    "## Channel break\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the lines of the channel become closer and a well defined channel is formed - the supply and demand may be in equilibrium \n",

    "## Bollinger laws\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Bollinger bands provide a relative definition of cheap and expensive - by definition **upper band** means *expensive* and **lower band** means *cheap*\n",
    "2. The relative definition can be applied to compare the price movement but, the movement itself (not only the bands) should be used to make more precise buy and sell decisions\n",
    "3. Useful trading indicators can be derived from\n",
    "   1. momentum\n",
    "   2. volume\n",
    "   3. sentiment\n",
    "   4. open interest\n",
    "   5. data across markets\n",
    "   6. etc\n",
    "4. If you're using two or more trading indicators, they shall be of different types *\"two momentum indicators aren't better then one\"*\n",
    "5. Bollinger bands can be used to identify / elucidate price patterns like *M* on top or *W* on bottom\n",
    "6. The mere crossing of the prices with band's limits does not indicate that you should buy or sell anything (at least not by itself - again, **use more indicators**)\n",
    "7. In markets of high tendency (upward or downward trend) the prices will **cross both** top and bottom bands\n",
    "8. Market close outside the bands are **continuation** indicators, not **reversion**\n",
    "9. The use of $20$ days for the calculation are not complete standards, it may work on the majority of the shares but better results can be archived by adapting this value to the specific stock / market that you're operating on\n",
    "10. The crossing of the prices with the central line does not indicate a **strong** new trend, it's a \"**medium**\" confirmation that a new trend is coming\n",
    "11. If you decide to change the amount of days used on the $sma$ you should also change the $stdev$ multiplication factor (lets call it $\\alpha$)\n",
    "    * **if** $d=20$ **then** $\\alpha$ should be $2$\n",
    "    * **if** $d=50$ **then** $\\alpha$ should be $2.1$\n",
    "    * **if** $d=10$ **then** $\\alpha$ should be $1.9$\n",
    "    * *Note: the book that I'm consulting to write this information does not make clear what rule should i use for any value of $d$* ![](https://i.ibb.co/SxvbjNg/Screenshot-20200213-123109.png) From regressions calculated on Geogebra, considering only this three examples we can arrive in some formula between\n",
    "    * $\\alpha(days)=0.0046 * days + 1.8791$ (*linear*) **to** $\\alpha(days) = 1.88 \\ * \\ 1^days$ (*fitting growth*) \n",
    "12. The traditional Bolling bands uses a **simple moving average** to be logically consistent because that's what is used to calculate the **standard deviation**\n",
    "13. You can use the **exponential moving average** in the calculations - this will eliminate sudden changes in the band width caused by a large price changes - this average shall be used for the moving average and the standard deviation on all lines\n",
    "14. Do not make statistical assumptions based on the standard deviation - the distribution is **not normal** and the  $n$ of samples aren't big enough for having **statistical significance** (you could expect $90\\%$ instead of $95\\%$ of the data inside the band with the default parameters)\n",
    "15. Bollinger bands does not provide a continuous signalization - instead they help to identify configurations where the probabilities may be in your favor\n",
